# hello-world
It’s the not-obligatory github test repository.

According to the github tutorial, I am supposed to write something about myself in this file. But I won’t, haha! Take that, tutorial, for trying to tell me what to do. Oh no! I’ve revealed something about myself within these words! You won this round, github tutorial, but rest not! For I shall return.
